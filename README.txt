I Built This Program Using C++ , OOP And Some Of STLs Containers
In This Program There Are Two Main Menus One For Developers (IT Department Of Bank)
And Other For Bank's Clients

In Developers Section, You First Have To Enter 
Name And Password Of Admin To Access This Menu Where Developers Can :
1) Create New Accounts whether One Or More Account
2) Edit Information Of Accounts That Already Exist In System (Name/Password/Age/Phone/Address/Is Client Married Or Not)
3) Show All Clients' Information In System In Addition To History Of Transactions For Every Client With Same Order Of Transaction 
(Number Of Deposit(s) & Value Of Each One/ Number Withdraw(s) & Value Of Each One/Transfer Money From Acc. X To Acc. Y Of Value Z) 

The Other Menu Is For Clients Where They First Have To Enter Thier Name And Password So, They Can Have Access For Their Accounts If
The Name And The Password Were Correct, They Will Go To Client's Home Page Where They Can :
1) Deposit Money
2) Withdraw Money
3) Transfer Money To Other Accounts By Using Account ID
4) Delete Their Accounts Permanently

--> I Have Handled Many Cases To Prevent Any Errors As : 
Deposit Zero/Negative Value Of Money
Withdraw Zero/Negative Value Of Money Or Higher Than Value Of Money In Account
Transfer Money To Not Existing Account ID Or Transfer Money To Existing Account ID With Wrong Value Of Money (Zero/Negative/Higher Than That In Acc.)
There Is Only One Client In System So, Transfering Money Option Will Not Be Shown
If There Is No Clients In System Messege Will Be Shown Instead Of Showning Entering Name And Password Menu
